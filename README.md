# bwrap

A basic python binary wrapper.

## Objectives and Stretch Goals*

- A basic python binary wrapper that can be used to quickly scaffold a python interface around a binary.
- Scaffolding framework that can be defined and enforced or loosely applied.
- A `contrib` module that provides contributed scaffolds for common binaries.
- Auto-generate (using help, version, and source data) starter bwrap scaffold manifests.

_* Note: Nothing here is a priority_
